\section*{Q1}
Let $X_1 ... X_40$ be a set of random variables such that $X_i = 1$ is the event that box $i$ is empty
after all $80$ balls have been placed, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.
Then the number of boxes empty after all balls are placed, which let's call $T$, is 
\[
T = \sum_{i=1}^{40} X_i
\]
Then,
\[
E[T] = E[\sum_{i=1}^{40} X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{40} E[X_i]
\]
The expected value of any $X_i$ is the same and can be calculated as,
\[
E[X_i] = 1*P(X_i = 1) + 0 * P(X_i = 0) = P(X_i = 1) = \frac{39}{40}^{80} = 0.13193780538
\]
Therefore,
\[
E[T] = \sum_{i=1}^{40} E[X_i] = 40 * 0.13193780538 = 5.27751221548
\]
A similar procedure is used to find the vaiance of $T$.
We know that the variance of $T$ is equal to $E[T^2] - E[T]^2 = E[T^2] - 27.85213518454$.
Then,
\[
E[T^2] = E[ \sum_{i=1}^{40}\sum_{j=1}^{40}X_i X_j] = \sum_{i=1}^{40}\sum_{j=1}^{40}E[X_i X_j]
\]
