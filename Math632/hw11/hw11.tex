Let $N(t)$ be the number of customer arrivals after time $t$. 
Then since $F$ is independent of $G$ then by the expectation of a random sum,
$$
E[W(t)] = E[N(t)]\mu_G
$$
then our limit becomes
$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{E[N(t)]\mu_G}{t} 
$$
$$
= \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{E[N(t)]\mu_G}{N(t)}\frac{N(t)}{t}
$$
which by theorem 3.1 is
$$
\frac{\mu_G}{\mu_F} \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{E[N(t)]}{N(t)} 
$$
which by Law of Large Numbers is simply
$$
\frac{\mu_G}{\mu_F}
$$

\section*{Q2}
Each child's shooting time follows a geometric distribution with expected value $1/p_i$
Then let $t_i$ be the total time for all the kids to shoot their $i^{th}$ time. 
Then for arbitrary kid $j$ for time $i$ let 
$s_i$ be the time it takes kid $j$ to get a basket and $u_i$  the total time it takes the other two kids to make their baskets. 
Then since $(s_i, u_i)$ are independent, then by theorem 3.4 the limiting fraction of the time spent by player $j$ shooting is 
$$
E[s_i] / (E[u_i] + E[s_i])
$$  

so for $p_1 = 2/3, p_2 = 3/4, p_3 = 4/5$ 

we have $t_1 = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ where $X_1 \sim Geometric(2/3), X_2 \sim Geometric(3/4), X_3 \sim Geometric(4/5)$ 

then expected fraction of the time player 1 is shooting is,
$$
E[X_1]/(E[X_1] + E[X_2 + X_3]) = \frac{3/2}{3/2 + 4/3 + 5/4} = 0.36735
$$

the expected fraction for player 2 is 
$$
0.32653
$$

and for player 3 is,
$$
0.30612
$$
