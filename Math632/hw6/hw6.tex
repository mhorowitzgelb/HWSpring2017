\section*{Q1}
Let our state space be $[T,C]$. Then we can think of one vehicle following another vehicle as a transition 
with transition matrix,
\[
p_{i,j} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1/4 & 3/4\\
1/5 & 4/5
\end{bmatrix}
\]
We can then solve for the stationary distribution of this transition matrix simply since it is a 2x2 matrix.

\[
\pi_T = \frac{1/5}{1/5 + 3/4} = 0.2105, 
\pi_C = \frac{3/4}{1/5 + 3/4} = 0.7895
\]

Then since $p_{i,j} \neq 0$ for all $i,j$, then clearly $p$ is irreducible and aperiodic. Then since our state space is finite and we have a stationary distribution $\pi$, then theorem 1.19 says the probability of being a truck converges to $\pi_T = 0.2105$. 

\section*{Q2}
For this we simply solve for the set of functions
\[
\pi_1 - (0.86\pi_1 + 0.05\pi_2 + 0.03\pi_3) = 0
\]
\[
	\pi_2 - (0.08\pi_1 + 0.88\pi_2 + 0.05 \pi_3)= 0
\]
\[
	\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1
\]

Then,
\[
\pi = [0,0,1]\begin{bmatrix}
0.14 & -0.08 & 1 \\
-0.05 & 0.12 & 1\\
-0.04 & -0.05 & 1
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
 = [ 0.2155477 ,  0.33215548,  0.45229682]
\]

Then since $p$ is finite and $p_{i,j} \neq 1$ for all $i,j$ then $p$  is irreducible and is aperiodic, we may again apply theorem 1.19 to say that in the long run,
$\pi_1 = 0.2155477$ fraction of the population will reside in cities, $\pi_2 = 0.33215548$ fraction of people will reside in suburbs and $\pi_3 = 0.45229682$ fraction of people will reside in rural areas.

\section*{Q3}
\subsection*{a.}
Using the same strategy as Q2 we first solve for a stationary distribution to get
\[
\pi = [ 0.36363636,  0.35664336,  0.27972028]
\]
 
Then since p is finite and $p_{i,j} \neq 0$ for all $i,j$ then we again can apply 1.19 to say,  
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} p^n(1,2) = 0.35664336
\]
\subsection*{b.}
Then since $p$ is irreducible and closed, then it is recurrent, and we may apply theorem 1.21 which says,
\[
\frac{N_n(2)}{n} \rightarrow \frac{1}{E_2T_2}
\]
and as shown in a.,
\[
\frac{N_n(2)}{n} \rightarrow \pi_2
\]
so ,
\[
\pi_2 = \frac{1}{E_2T_2}
\]
and
\[
E_2T_2 -1 = 1/\pi_2 -1 = 1.8039
\]
\subsection*{c.}
\[
E[\text{walking distance}] = \sum_{n} p(n) * (0.3 + 0.1n)
\]
\[
= \sum_{n} \pi_n * (0.3 + 0.1n) = 0.4916
\]

\section*{Q4}
\subsection*{i}
Our state space is $[1,2,2']$ where the number indicates the number of light bulbs working and ' indicates we just replaced  the light bulbs.
Then our transition matrix is
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0.95 & 0 & 0.05\\
0.02 & 0.98 & 0\\
0.02 & 0.98 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Solving for the stationary distribution we get,
\[
\pi = [ 0.2857,  0.7       ,  0.0143]
\]
Then since $p$ is finite and nonzero for all $i,j$, then it is irreducible and theorem 1.19 says that the long run fraction of time one light bulb is working is $\pi_1 = 0.2857$. 

\subsection*{ii}
Then we can use theorem 1.21 to say that
\[
E_2T_{2'} - 1 = 1/\pi_{2'} -1 = 69
\]
So the expected number of days between light bulb is 69 days.
