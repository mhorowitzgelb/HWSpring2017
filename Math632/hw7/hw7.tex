First without loss of generality we may assume the starting position is at time 1 since otherwise we could simply rename all the states by rotating the clock until the starting position was 1. Also note that all states communicate with state 1 since there is at most a shortest path of length 6 from any state to 1 with a probability of $0.5^{6}$ of occurring.
Then using this, we may apply theorem 1.28 and say that
if $g(x)$ is the expected number of transitions required to first get to state 1, then
$g(1) = 0$ and for $x \neq 1$
\[
g(x) = 1 + \sum_y p(x,y)g(y) = 1 + \sum_y r(x,y)g(y)
\]
where $r$ is $p$ restricted to $\{2 .. 12\}$.
Then we can solve
\[
g[2 .. 12] = (I - r)^{-1} \vec{1}
\]
$g$ turns out to be ,
\[
[0, 11,  20,  27,  32,  35,  36,  35,  32,  27,  20,  11]^T
\]

Then since with probability 1 the starting state will transition to 2 or 12, then the expected the expected number of steps it will take $X_n$ to return to the starting position is
\[
1 + 0.5 * g(2) + 0.5 * g(12) = 1 + 0.5 * 11 + 0.5 * 11 = 12
\]

\section*{Q4}
First since the problem was not clear on edge cases I assume $p(1,2) = 1$ and $p(6,5) = 1$ . With that we first realize clearly that all states communicate with state 1 since each contains a shortest path to state 1 of positive probability. 
So we again may use theorem 1.28 where our exit state is 1. 
and solve for $g$
\[
g[2 .. 6] = (I - r)^{-1} \vec{1}
\]
And it turns out $g$ is equal to 
\[
g = [0 , 2.875,   5.625,   8.125,  10.125,  11.125]^T
\]
So since state 1 transitions to 2 with probability 1 then
\[
E_1T_1 = 1 + g(2) = 3.875
\]

\section*{Q5}
Let $C = {G,A}$. Then since $p(G,F) > 0$ and $p(A,B) > 0$ then clearly $\rho_{xF} + \rho_{xB} > 0 $ for both $x = G$ and $x= A$.
Then let $h(x) = P_x(V_F < V_B)$, and using theorem 1.27,
$h(F) = 1, h(B) = 0$, and for $x \in C$,
\[
h(x) = r(x,F) + \sum_y r(x,y)h(y)
\]
where $r$ is $p$ restricted to $\{G,A\}$
Then,

\[
h[G,A] = (I - r)^{-1}v
\]
where, $v$ is a column vector of $p(x,F)$.

$h$ turns out to be
\[
[ 0.875,  0.75 ]^T
\]
Therefore the probability of paying of your debt in full given you are in good standing is 0.875 and 0.75 if you are in arrears.
