\section*{Q1}
\subsection*{a}
Let $T_0 = 0$ represent the time at 8 AM. Then the probability that no people show up from 8 to 10 AM is equal to 
$$
P(T_1-T_0 > 2) = 1 - F_{exp(3)}(2) = 0.00248
$$ 

\subsection*{b}
$T_n$ is a Poisson process with rate 3 so by definition, $T_1 - T_0 \sim exp(3)$

\section*{Q2}
\subsection*{a}
Let $T_n$ be a Poisson process of cars passing through. Then let $T_0 = 0$ be the last time a car passed before the dear crosses the road. Then let $\alpha \geq 0$ be the time at which the dear crosses the road.
Then the probability that a car hits the dear is equivalent to 
$$
P(T_{k} - \alpha < 1/12)
$$ where $T_k = min\{T_n : T_n > \alpha\}$
Because of the memoryless of the exponential distribution this is equal to, 
$$
\sum_{i > 0} p(k = i)F_{exp(6)}(1/12) = F_{exp(6)}(1/12) \sum_{i > 0} p(k = i) = F_{exp(6)}(1/12) = 0.39347
$$
\subsection*{b}
If the deer only needs 2 seconds to cross the road then the problem is the same and the probability of getting hit is,
$$
F_{exp(6)}(1/30) = 0.18127
$$

\section*{Q3}
If $A$ is the total number of muons in the day, then $A$ is a sum of 3 Poisson random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$,representing different the different signal rates throughout the day.We then have that 

$X_1 \sim 8 Poisson(240), \qquad X_2 \sim 9Poisson(360), \qquad X_3 \sim 7Poisson(420)$

Then since a sum of Poissons is Poisson,
$$
A \sim Poisson(8100)
$$

And therefore,
$$
Var(A) = 8100
$$


\section*{Q4}
Let $Y_1, ... Y_N$ be a set of iid random variables representing the amount of money withdrawn from each customer, each with mean 30 and variance 400. Then let $N$ be a Poisson random variable with rate 80 representing the number of customers over the span of 8 hours. 
Finally let $S = \sum_{i = 1} ^ N Y_i$ be the total amount of money withdrawn
Then since $|E[Y_i]| = 30 < \infty$ and $E[N] = 80 < \infty$ 
$$
E[S] = E[N] \cdot E[Y_i] = 80 * 30 = 2400
$$
and since $N$ is Poisson with finite rate then,
$$
Var(S) = 80 * E[Y_i^2] = 80 * ( Var(Y_i) + E[Y_i]^2) = 80*(400 + 900) = 104000
$$
$$
Stdev(S) = 104000^{0.5} = 322.49031
$$
