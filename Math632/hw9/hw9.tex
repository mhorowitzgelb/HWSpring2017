\section*{Q1}
\subsection*{a}
Let $T_0 = 0$ represent the time at 8 AM. Then the probability that no people show up from 8 to 10 AM is equal to 
$$
P(T_1-T_0 > 2) = 1 - F_{exp(3)}(2) = 0.00248
$$ 

\subsection*{b}
$T_n$ is a Poisson process with rate 3 so by definition, $T_1 - T_0 \sim exp(3)$

\section*{Q2}
\subsection*{a}
Let $T_n$ be a Poisson process of cars passing through. Then let $T_0 = 0$ be the last time a car passed before the dear crosses the road. Then let $\alpha \geq 0$ be the time at which the dear crosses the road.
Then the probability that a car hits the dear is equivalent to 
$$
P(T_{k} - \alpha < 1/12)
$$ where $T_k = min\{T_n : T_n > \alpha\}$
Because of the memoryless of the exponential distribution this is equal to, 
$$
\sum_{i > 0} p(k = i)(F_{exp(6)}(1/12) = (F_{exp(6)}(1/12) \sum_{i > 0} p(k = i) = (F_{exp(6)}(1/12) = 0.39347
$$
